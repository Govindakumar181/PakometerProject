              <p class="lead">I am a resident of Pakistan, pursuing B.Sc. (Computer Science) from University of Karachi. My father is a daily wage labourer and mother is a housewife. Our annual income is pretty low wrt to the average nation’s income. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into the firm as an intern. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open a new horizon of the world of Coursera courses for me. That, in turn, will help me in future goal and building a successful career. I also plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in the previous course. The Finacial Aid will only push me further towards my goals and my dreams of one day having a successful career.
